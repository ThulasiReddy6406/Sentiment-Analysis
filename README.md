# Sentiment-Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on text reviews using a simple rule-based approach. Instead of relying on heavy libraries like sklearn or nltk, we define our own positive and negative word lists and analyze reviews by counting their occurrence.  The program classifies each review into POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.
